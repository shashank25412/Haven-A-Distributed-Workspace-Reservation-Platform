# Haven-A-Distributed-Workspace-Reservation-Platform

### A production-minded, multi-tenant workspace reservation backend built with Modern C++

Haven is a backend platform for discovering and reserving shared resources such as meeting rooms, office desks, parking slots, and other bookable assets—without double bookings, duplicate commands, or unreliable event delivery.

## Overview

Haven is a portfolio-grade backend system designed to demonstrate the engineering decisions expected in a production reservation platform:

- concurrency-safe reservation workflows;
- multi-tenant data isolation;
- idempotent write APIs;
- approval workflows for priority resources;
- reliable event delivery using a transactional outbox;
- derived availability instead of duplicated state;
- observable, testable, and containerized infrastructure.

The project is intentionally structured as a **modular monolith**. It keeps the first production version operationally simple while preserving clear boundaries that can later be extracted into services when scale or team ownership justifies it.

> **Development status:** the architecture, requirements, ADRs, API design, data model, and operational design are established. Implementation is proceeding phase by phase.

---

## The Problem

Reservation systems look simple until multiple users try to reserve the same resource concurrently.

A production-quality solution must answer questions such as:

- What happens when two requests attempt to reserve the same room at the same time?
- Can a client safely retry after a timeout?
- How is availability calculated without becoming stale?
- What happens when Kafka is unavailable after a reservation is committed?
- How are organizations prevented from reading or modifying each other's data?
- Can an approval succeed if the resource became unavailable while the request was pending?

Haven treats these as core consistency and reliability problems—not edge cases.

---

## Key Features

### Reservation workflows

- Search active resources by organization, type, location, capacity, and features.
- Create reservations for fixed start and end times.
- Auto-confirm normal resources when the slot is free.
- Route priority resources through an approval workflow.
- Cancel or extend existing reservations through legal state transitions.
- Derive calendar and availability views from authoritative reservation data.

### Correctness and reliability

- Prevent overlapping confirmed reservations using a transactional schedule guard.
- Use half-open intervals: `[startTime, endTime)`.
- Scope idempotency records by tenant, caller, operation, and idempotency key.
- Persist reservation state and outbox events in the same Couchbase transaction.
- Publish Kafka events asynchronously with at-least-once delivery.
- Deduplicate consumer processing by `eventId`.
- Keep Redis outside the correctness boundary.

### Production engineering

- JWT authentication and application-layer authorization.
- Multi-tenant repository contracts.
- Structured logs, metrics, traces, health checks, and readiness checks.
- Bounded retries with backoff and failure classification.
- Docker Compose local environment.
- Unit, integration, concurrency, contract, and end-to-end test strategy.

### Architectural principles

| Principle | Haven's approach |
|---|---|
| Deployment model | Modular monolith with explicit module boundaries |
| Source of truth | Couchbase |
| Availability | Derived from resources and overlapping confirmed reservations |
| Concurrency control | Optimistic transactions and per-resource daily schedule guards |
| Command deduplication | Scoped idempotency records with payload hashes |
| Event reliability | Transactional outbox and at-least-once Kafka delivery |
| Cache role | Performance optimization only |
| Tenant isolation | Trusted caller context propagated into every repository operation |
| Failure handling | Typed errors, bounded retries, backoff, DLQs, and observable degradation |

Detailed diagrams are available in [`docs/diagrams`](docs/diagrams):

- [`architecture.drawio`](docs/diagrams/architecture.drawio)
- [`sequence.drawio`](docs/diagrams/sequence.drawio)
- [`class.drawio`](docs/diagrams/class.drawio)
- [`deployment.drawio`](docs/diagrams/deployment.drawio)
- [`state.drawio`](docs/diagrams/state.drawio)

---

## Core Consistency Model

### Availability is derived

Haven does not maintain a separate authoritative availability document.

For a requested interval:

```text
available resources
    = active resources matching the search filters
    - resources with overlapping CONFIRMED reservations
```

Two intervals overlap when:

```text
existing.start < requested.end
&&
existing.end > requested.start
```

Search results are advisory. Reservation creation, approval, and extension always revalidate the slot inside the authoritative write transaction.

### Double-booking prevention

Each resource has a date-partitioned schedule guard containing its confirmed intervals.

A write transaction:

1. loads the relevant guard document;
2. checks for interval overlap;
3. updates the guard;
4. persists the reservation;
5. persists the idempotency result;
6. persists the outbox event;
7. commits all changes atomically.

If two transactions race, only one can commit the expected guard version. The losing transaction reloads the latest state and either retries safely or returns a business conflict.

### Transactional outbox

Haven never publishes to Kafka inside the reservation transaction.

Instead, the transaction stores an outbox event alongside the reservation. A relay later:

1. claims pending events using optimistic concurrency;
2. publishes them to Kafka;
3. records the broker acknowledgment;
4. marks the outbox event as published.

A relay crash can cause duplicate delivery, but it cannot silently lose the event. Consumers therefore process events idempotently using `eventId`.

## Reservation Lifecycle

```text
                         approve + recheck
PENDING_APPROVAL  ─────────────────────────►  CONFIRMED
       │                                         │
       ├── reject ──► REJECTED                   ├── cancel ──► CANCELLED
       └── cancel ──► CANCELLED                  ├── extend ──► CONFIRMED
                                                 ├── complete ─► COMPLETED
                                                 └── expire ───► EXPIRED
```

Pending approval does not reserve capacity in the MVP. Availability is checked again when an approver confirms the request.

The dependency direction is intentionally inward:

```text

Infrastructure ──────┘
```

The domain layer does not depend on Drogon, Couchbase, Redis, Kafka, or JSON serialization.

---

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- CMake 3.25+
- A C++20-compatible compiler
- Git

### Start infrastructure and the application

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Haven

cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build -d
```

Check the service:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health/live
curl http://localhost:8080/health/ready
```

View logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f haven-api
```

Stop the environment:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Native build

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

> Commands and service names may evolve while the implementation skeleton is being finalized. The Docker Compose file and CMake targets remain the source of truth.

---

## Configuration

Runtime configuration is supplied through environment variables or mounted configuration files.

Typical settings include:

```dotenv
HAVEN_HTTP_PORT=8080
HAVEN_LOG_LEVEL=info

COUCHBASE_CONNECTION_STRING=couchbase://couchbase
COUCHBASE_USERNAME=Administrator
COUCHBASE_PASSWORD=password
COUCHBASE_BUCKET=haven

REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379

KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=kafka:9092
KAFKA_RESERVATION_TOPIC=haven.reservation.events.v1

JWT_ISSUER=https://identity.example.com/
JWT_AUDIENCE=haven-api
JWT_JWKS_URI=https://identity.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
```

Secrets must never be committed to the repository. Production deployments should use a dedicated secret-management system.

---

## Testing Strategy

Haven uses multiple test layers because correctness cannot be demonstrated through unit tests alone.

### Unit tests

- interval-overlap rules;
- reservation state transitions;
- policy validation;
- idempotency payload matching;
- event serialization;
- error mapping.

### Integration tests

- Couchbase repositories and indexes;
- multi-document transactions;
- schedule-guard conflicts;
- Redis fallback behavior;
- Kafka publishing and consumer deduplication;
- OpenAPI contract validation.

### Concurrency tests

- multiple requests for the same resource and interval;
- approval racing with cancellation;
- extension racing with a new reservation;
- duplicate requests using the same idempotency key;
- relay crashes around Kafka acknowledgments.

### End-to-end tests

- search → create → retrieve;
- create → approve;
- create → cancel;
- create → extend;
- reservation event → notification/reporting consumer.

Run the test suite:

```bash
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

---

## Observability

Every request and event-processing path carries correlation metadata.

Key signals include:

- HTTP latency and error rates;
- reservation conflicts;
- Couchbase transaction retries;
- Redis hits, misses, and timeouts;
- outbox backlog size and oldest-event age;
- Kafka publishing failures and consumer lag;
- duplicate consumer deliveries;
- DLQ growth;
- readiness and dependency health.

High-cardinality identifiers such as `reservationId`, `resourceId`, and `eventId` belong in structured logs and traces—not metric labels.

---

## Failure Behaviour

| Failure | Expected behaviour |
|---|---|
| Redis unavailable | Bypass cache and continue through Couchbase |
| Kafka unavailable | Commit reservation and retain event in the outbox |
| Couchbase unavailable | Fail authoritative operations safely and mark the instance unready |
| Duplicate client request | Return the original stored result |
| Concurrent overlapping write | One transaction wins; the other returns a conflict |
| Consumer crash | Kafka redelivers; consumer deduplicates by `eventId` |
| Poison event | Retry with limits, then route to a consumer-specific DLQ |
| Identity provider unavailable | Continue validating tokens with cached trusted keys while valid |

---

## Documentation

The design is documented before implementation so that code can be reviewed against explicit decisions rather than implicit assumptions.

Start here:

1. [`docs/00-introduction.md`](docs/00-introduction.md)
2. [`docs/01-requirements.md`](docs/01-requirements.md)
3. [`docs/02-high-level-design.md`](docs/02-high-level-design.md)
4. [`docs/03-low-level-design.md`](docs/03-low-level-design.md)
5. [`docs/04-domain-model.md`](docs/04-domain-model.md)

Important technical deep dives:

- [`docs/06-database-design.md`](docs/06-database-design.md)
- [`docs/07-event-driven-design.md`](docs/07-event-driven-design.md)
- [`docs/08-concurrency.md`](docs/08-concurrency.md)
- [`docs/10-security.md`](docs/10-security.md)
- [`docs/11-observability.md`](docs/11-observability.md)
- [`docs/12-testing.md`](docs/12-testing.md)

Architecture decisions are captured as ADRs, including the modular monolith, Couchbase, Drogon, optimistic locking, Kafka, Redis, JWT authentication, and transactional outbox choices.

---

## Design Trade-offs

Haven deliberately avoids several premature optimizations:

- no microservices before independent scaling or ownership requires them;
- no separate availability projection as an MVP correctness dependency;
- no Redis lock for reservation safety;
- no synchronous Kafka publishing inside business transactions;
- no recurring reservations in the first release;
- no distributed transaction across Couchbase and Kafka.

These constraints keep the system explainable, testable, and operationally realistic.

---

## Project Goals

Haven is built as both a useful system and an engineering case study. It is intended to demonstrate:

- production-grade Modern C++ backend design;
- clean boundaries and dependency inversion;
- practical concurrency control;
- event-driven reliability patterns;
- database-aware data modelling;
- operational thinking beyond the happy path;
- senior-level design communication through documentation and ADRs.

---

## Contributing

This project is currently developed as a focused portfolio system. Issues and design discussions are welcome.

Before contributing:

1. read the documents under `AI_CONTEXT/`;
2. review the relevant design documents and ADRs;
3. keep domain logic independent of frameworks;
4. add tests for all changed behaviour;
5. update documentation when a design decision changes.

---

## License

A license will be added before the first public release.
